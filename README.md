Q1-project-1
This code provides a class WordFrequency Analyzer that can analyze the frequency of word in a given text. The class manintains a dictionary of word frequencies, processes each word, and allows you to retrieve the top n most frequent words. The helper function analyze_text handles text processing and an example usage section demonstrates how the system works.

Q2-project-2
Implement a class that provides a weighted sum average of the last n entries of a digitized signal. 
y[n]=(w[0]x[0]+w[1]x[1]+...+w[n-1]x[n-1])/n
x holds the last n entries where index 0 in x is the current entry.
weights = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]# list weights containing five elements, representing the weights used in the weighted average.
signal = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]#signal values that will be processed through the WeightedAverage class to compute the weighted averages.

Q3-project-3
We reverse each number by repeatedly extracting the last digit using the modulus operator % and rebuilding the reverse number.

Q4-project-4
